# Topic-Modeling-NLP
Many techniques are used to obtain topic models. This paper aims
to demonstrate the implementation of LDA: a widely used topic
modeling technique and how to visualize the obtained topics. We
use the topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) from genism
package for extracting the topics from the abstracts and titles of
different research papers present in the almetric data. We show the
correlation among different topics extracted from both the abstracts
and titles. We have done different visualizations like frequency
distribution of word counts in documents, word counts of Top N
keywords in each topic, word counts of topic keywords, sentence
chart colored by topic, dominant topics in the documents,
pyLDAVis interactive chart visualization.
